# COMPUTATIONAL EVALUATION OF THE NEURAL ACTIVITY MODEL OF RETINOTOPIC MAP FORMATION
A computational model was constructed in the Python™ and Cython programming languages and used to evaluate Willshaw and Malsburg’s neural activity theory of topographically organised network development. The investigation focuses on the development of retinotopic maps in the optic tectum of fish and amphibians. This study demonstrates that the neural activity model is able to successfully explain the systems-matching results observed in surgical mismatch experiments and that the model is robust to different patterns of retinal activity. Eight different types of retinal activity pattern are investigated, and a novel function is developed to allow quantitative assessment of the retinotopic maps produced by the model.
